# ModSynth Website

This is a website created as part of an assessment in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

I used Bootstrap as well as some other CSS to fulfill the technical requirements.

There are two forms in the main page that use JavaScript.

* The synth chooser form randomly chooses a synth model
* The mailing list form keeps a list of email addresses that have been entered to prevent duplicates. It also validates 
that the phone number entered is a valid US number.
